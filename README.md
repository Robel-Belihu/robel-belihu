A Software developer specializing in JavaScript technologies. 
Experienced in tech stacks listed below

Started web development back in 2017 as a hobby and I grew to love it when I started working on real projects. I expanded my skillset through hard work and dedication on day to day basis. I first got the chance to be part of some interesting projects a little over two years ago and I have been working on myself to acquire more skills and be more efficient ever since.  <img src="https://media.tenor.com/cWWoEqW-gicAAAAi/smiley-face.gif" width="15px">
